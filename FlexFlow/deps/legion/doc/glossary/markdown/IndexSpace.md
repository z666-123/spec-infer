# IndexSpace

An IndexSpace defines the set of points that comprise a LogicalRegion.
An IndexSpace is like the columns of a table in a Relational data base.
An IndexSpace may have 1, 2 or 3 dimensions and may be regular or irregular.
LogicalRegions are constructed by taking the cross product of an IndexSpace with a FieldSpace.
