# Color Space

Region color space versus partition color space

The first step in creating a partition is to create a Domain
which describes the the color space of the partition
(the Domain must either be an unstructured index space or a 1D Rect).
The purpose of a color space is to associate a single color
(point within the color space domain) with each index sub-space we wish to make.
