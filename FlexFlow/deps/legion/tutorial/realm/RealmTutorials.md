The following tutorial is meant to showcase Realm's programming
model, highlight existing interfaces and teach how to write Realm
programs in C++. This tutorial has an
incremental complexity that progressively exposes various Realm features.
It is designed to be a self-sufficient resource that provides a certain
amount of theoretical background necessary to work through the
examples.
